A customized mass texting App on the Google play store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.projoh.android.manymessage&hl=en

# Description
Send a customized text to as many contacts as you want easily with Many Message. Simply select your desired contacts, compose your message using variables such as the contact's first or last name, then send it to all your contacts at the click of a button. This also doubles as a mass texting application as you can text all your contacts whatever you desire.
This application offers custom variables you can compose your message to:

fname = First name of contact
lname = Last name of contact
cone1 = custom variable, maybe for the event name
cone2 = second custom variable

Many Message is a way to send mass SMS text messages, or bulk SMS messages to your contacts individually, appearing as direct SMS messages to them. It also allows for per-contact customization with the use of variables without the use of group texting. Other names that define sending many messages to many contacts include text blast or text blasting.
